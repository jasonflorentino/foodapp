# `api/`

The backend service to handle data requests.

Disclaimer: I've been wanting to learn Go, so here I am. Here it is. Will I ever stop tripping over this case-sensitive public/private thing? Who knows! But for real, since I'm only just learning, things may be written poorly. And since I'm also just wanting it to work sometimes, it may also end up as one messy file.

# Usage

You'll need to have `go` installed.

## Start the app

```
go run main.go
```
